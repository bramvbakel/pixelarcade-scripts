# PixelArcade Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts for managing, automating, and maintaining various aspects of the PixelArcade environment. The scripts are designed to simplify setup, backup, and routine maintenance tasks, making it easier to manage infrastructure and data for PixelArcade projects.

## Why This Collection?

These scripts were created as a hobby project to streamline repetitive or error-prone tasks, reduce manual work, and ensure consistency across systems. They are especially useful for:

- Quickly setting up new machines for development or deployment
- Automating regular backups to prevent data loss
- Maintaining a clean and organized infrastructure

## How to Use

Each subfolder contains a README with detailed instructions for its scripts. Review the relevant README before running any script, and ensure you have the necessary permissions and dependencies (such as Docker) installed.
