# Docker Environment Setup Script

This script (`install_docker_ubuntu.sh`) automates the setup of an Ubuntu system for Docker development. It installs Docker, Docker Compose, configures user permissions, sets the time zone, and ensures Docker starts on boot.

## How It Works

1. **Update Package Lists**  
   Runs `apt update` to refresh the list of available packages.
2. **Upgrade Installed Packages**  
   Runs `apt upgrade -y` to upgrade all installed packages to their latest versions.
3. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**  
   Installs both Docker Engine (`docker.io`) and Docker Compose (`docker-compose`).
4. **Add User to Docker Group**  
   Adds the current user to the `docker` group, allowing Docker commands without `sudo` (requires logout/login to take effect).
5. **Set Time Zone**  
   Sets the system time zone to the value specified in the `.env` file (see below for configuration) using `timedatectl`.
6. **Enable and Start Docker Service**  
   Enables Docker to start on boot and starts the Docker service immediately.

## Usage

1. Create your own `.env` file using the provided template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env to set TIMEZONE with your own value
   ```
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install_docker_ubuntu.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./install_docker_ubuntu.sh
   ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the script with the following variable:

```env
TIMEZONE="Europe/Amsterdam"
```

You can use `.env.example` as a template.

## Notes
- You may need to log out and log back in for the Docker group changes to take effect.
- The script must be run with a user that has `sudo` privileges.
- Set the time zone in the `.env` file to your desired value (e.g., Europe/Amsterdam).

## Troubleshooting
- If you cannot run Docker without `sudo` after running the script, log out and log back in, or reboot your system.
- If Docker fails to start, check the service status with `sudo systemctl status docker`.
